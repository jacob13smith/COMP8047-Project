Flutter project for the frontend GUI application of my BCIT COMP 8047 Major Application.

_Note: This application is currently only built for Linux machines and will not work on other platforms._

## How to run
Flutter SDK needs to be installed on your device to run the application in developer mode.  You can download and install this at https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux.

To run the application, make sure that the daemon (found in the upper /daemon/ directory) is running on your machine, the execute the following command to run the flutter application in dev mode:

`flutter run`

You will be prompted to choose which platform to build for.  Select the option associated with "Linux".

The program should start and a window should open with the GUI.
